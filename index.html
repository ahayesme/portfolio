		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Amani Hayes-Messinger is a Brown University undergrad pursuing a double concentration in Computer Science and American Studies. Committed to two courses of study that seem disperate, she is committed to finding the nexus of both passions through deep development in each both seperately and together. <br> <br>
        Amani's course work in Computer Science has been developed in Brown and RISD classrooms, with focuses on object oriented programming, design, systems, and user experience. Outside of coursework, Amani has applied her knowledge of computer science and learned tremendouly through teaching assistant positions, teaching 10-15 girls to code, and working on the development of Brown University Websites.<br><br>
        Currently splitting most of her time between writing a thesis in the American Studies Department and applying herself as a learner, teacher, and peer in the Computer Science Department, Amani spends the rest of her time helping to cultivate communities, particularly amongst students of color, an Brown's campus. She does this both through formal positions and for a love of supporting and being supported by powerful, diverse community networks.</p>
